# Fraction-Visualizer
Fraction Visualizer is a versatile, web-based application designed to simplify the concept of fractions for learners of all ages. With its interactive and user-friendly interface, 
it serves as an excellent educational tool for both children and adults to explore and understand fractions visually.

Features:
Interactive Learning Experience: Users can input any two fractions and visualize them as colored circles on a canvas, facilitating a better understanding of fraction sizes and relationships.
Adaptive Visuals: The visualizer dynamically adjusts the drawing of circles to prevent overlap, ensuring clear and distinct representations.
Educational Feedback: Provides immediate error messages if the fractions exceed the visual limit of 5 circles, reinforcing numerical boundaries and ratios.
Accessible Design: Simple, intuitive interface suitable for children while still offering the depth needed for adult learners.
Keyboard and Mouse Support: Enter key and click actions both trigger the visualization, accommodating different user preferences.
How to Use:
Launch the index.html file in a standard web browser.
Enter fractions in the format of numerator/denominator (e.g., 3/4) in the designated fields.
Click "Draw Fractions" or press 'Enter' to see the graphical representation of the fractions.
If the fractions exceed the visualization limit, an error message will guide the users to adjust their input.
Installation:
No specific installation required. Just download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser to start exploring fractions.
